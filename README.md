# GLDoc OpenGL documentation

Static HTML OpenGL documentation, because the online docs suck so much.

This is implemented as a single-page application using ember.js mainly because I want to experiment more with ember. I would probably be better off just auto-generating the static pages and perhaps using handlebars or something for formatting.

All information is derived from the [Khronos OpenGL API registry](https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/ogl/trunk/doc/registry/public/api/gl.xml)
